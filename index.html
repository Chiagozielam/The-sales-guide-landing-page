            Selling is both a science and an art. It is a science because when
            the proper techniques and principles are learnt and applied, almost
            nothing is left to chance. It’s also an art in the sense that these
            basic techniques has to fit the behaviour of the target market. Like
            every other skill, the science and art of selling must be learnt.

              <p>
                I am Joseph Don and this is my story; I’ve been a sales person
                from a very young age. As early as primary 3, I would trade my
                lunch for money.
              </p>
              <div id="main-about-me-details">
                <p>
                  Growing up, I watched (and of course helped) my mother as she
                  changed from one small scale business to another. Owing to these
                  experiences, I became really good in predicting buyers reactions
                  to any product, but that was all I could do – predict!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span style="font-size: 40px;">
                    The turning point really came when I started dropshipping
                    Laptops.
                  </span style="font-size: 20px">
                  Everything was right, the laptops were of good quality, my
                  supplies were trustworthy, I even went as far as setting up a
                  pretty good website, but my sales kept going down until the
                  business died.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For any young Nigerian who is unemployed, hustling and has a lot
                  of bills to pay, this is really painful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being a person who always tries to learn from failures, I
                  decided to re-evaluate and find out why my business failed. What
                  do you think it was? Of course you answered right! I couldn’t
                  sell right<br>
                  <p id="yellow-div" style="text-align: left;">
                    I didn’t know how to attract the attention my business
                    deserved and how to make my buyer’s interest align with mine.
                  </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I didn’t close many deals, there was little or no referrals and
                  my bank account and even wallet stayed empty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>
                    Now don’t get me wrong, I was hardworking, I told everyone I
                    knew about my business, I followed them up, rejection after
                    rejection, I kept trying, I even became pushy at times .
                  </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I will get back to you” became my most dreaded sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an ardent believer that all problems have solutions, I
                  decided to study the techniques of people who made billions out
                  of selling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was so hungry that I consumed all the books on sales I could
                  lay my hands on, paid for seminars, worked with top sales people
                  in my field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  – I needed answers (because to me, my whole life depended on my
                  ability to sell right)
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I learnt, I practiced it while building Kaizen Business
                  Academy (an educational platform where we train all age groups
                  on a variety of relevant high income skills).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have trained over a thousand students to acquire skills in
                  Cryptocurrency trading, Cryptocurrency exchange,
                  mini-importation, graphic design, instagram influencer
                  marketing, information marketing, and yes, sales and branding!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of the techniques were good but couldnot be readily applied
                  by Nigerians and Africans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The way things work in the western world is not the same here...
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I did was to modify each technique and monitor my results
                  closely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ones that worked perfectly all the time and for a wide range
                  of people, I shared with other sales people small business
                  owners and starting out entrepreneurs.

                  man it was like revision for me, because it addressed the
                  process of selling so it's easy for me to recommend your book

                    The 6,000 naira? I had the same issues you know. Putting my
                    hard earned money into things that after I paid, I felt like I
                    just lost money.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But then I discovered that those things were unnecessarily
                  enticing but no substance. <br />
                  <span>
                    But here's me, gone all out for you to document my experience
                    and do everything to help you and leave you with no excuses to
                    succed except you buy this and dump this.

                    But why will you? You've stayed this long on this page. It
                    shows me you're a serious person.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Go ahead and make that decision. You would send me a mail of
                  gratefulness later on.
                  <span>
                    And if you don't? I'd send you a mail to be sure you're
                    getting the most of it.
